bib.1.t: "Supercharging the EPA"
bib.1.d: "Waste, trash, harmful chemicals, beasts of the wasteland lurking in the dark, there is no shortage of bullshit in the post-war America. Now that we control the whole of the continental United States, our focus needs to turn inwards. The plan is quite simple: the EPA, now one of our most important institutions, will undergo a monumental expansion, as unprecedented amounts of work will need to be done to clean up this land of the free. Some are saying it is a second army, for it surely has the manpower and budget, the latter which has grown exponentially with some calling for restraint."
bib.1.a: "LETS GO"

bib.2.t: "The New York Stock Exchange"
bib.2.d: "The New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, was the crown jewel of our economic system before the war, a symbol of capitalism, the NYSE was the largest stock exchange in the world, with its floor attracting tourists from all over the world as a Mecca of finance. Situated in the Financial district of New York City, the NYSE building was finished in 1903 with its classical revival architecture, with much of it now in ruins, you can still see leftover tickers from the pre-war, with Nuka-Cola up 1.7% right as the bombs dropped. Much work will be put into restoring the building to its former glory as it was viewed as a symbol of America."
bib.2.a: "Time to buy?"

bib.3.t: "The 200 Year Crash"
bib.3.d: "In the early hours of the morning, the NYSE opened for what seemed to be a normal trading day in the new stock market. Traders and brokers filled the floor, and the bell rang to cheers from the crowd.\nHowever, as the day went on, odd behavior was noticed. Some previously stable stocks behaved in a volatile manner, and some unknown stocks skyrocketed in value. The NYSE was soon engulfed in a stark divide. Some traders took the opportunity to profit off the volatility, while others had a bad feeling about the whole situation. Some sold, some held, and some, for some reason, were completely absent the whole day.\nThis volatile period continued into the early afternoon. Suddenly, institutional investors began a mass sell-off of stocks from most companies, prompting panic on the floor. Panic turned into horror as the market plummeted by 30% in the blink of an eye. The new stock market, with no circuit breakers implemented, fell into a downward spiral as the mass selloff continued. The average investor took the brunt of the fall, only getting to sell what little remained once the market had already taken a skydive.\nSoon, the news broke to the general population. Ever since the NYSE opened, there was a wave of excitement surrounding it. Everyday people, having heard about the old NYSE, abandoned the western markets and hoped to cash in on the massive gains they heard happened in the old world. With little to no regulation implemented, corporations soon cooked the books in their financial reports, hoping to convince the public and get a cut of this wave of investments.\nAnd so they did, until a whistleblower from one of the top corporations revealed the truth on the radio that same day. Institutional investors, tipped off about it, had already sold early in the day, causing the volatility and the subsequent crash as the news spread. Crowds soon gathered outside the NYSE building, watching as the old stock exchange was brought down by the naivety of the new world. Finally, after the NYSE managed to pull themselves together, the markets closed early.\nBut it was too late. The damage had been done.\n\nThe NYSE crashed for the first time in 200 years."
bib.3.a: "It just keeps going down"

bib.4.t: "The Federal Trade Commission"
bib.4.d: "Following the fallout of the NYSE crash, many in our administration are calling for the resurrection of a pre-war agency, the FTC. The agency was gutted by our predecessors in the years before the great war, now recognized as a mistake, which contributed to the insane levels of corruption and corporate greed of the pre-war. We must correct the course, as the NYSE crash showed us, there is great need for the FTC to act decisively in favor of consumer protection and fair practices. The agency will be reestablished, along with many others related to the financial system soon."
bib.4.a: "Our institutions are our strength"

bib.5.t: "Market Stabilization"
bib.5.d: "Finally, after all our hard work restoring financial institutions, the market has been relatively stabilized. The big corporations who misled the public have been prosecuted and their executives held accountable. The NYSE is now operating with a new set of rules and regulations, designed to prevent another crash like the one we saw. The public is slowly regaining trust in the stock market, and the economy is starting to recover. We have learned from our mistakes, and we will not let greed and corruption destroy our financial system again."
bib.5.a: "I should have bought the dip"

bib.6.t: "Los Angeles"
bib.6.d: "The Los Angeles metropolitan area, now called the Boneyard by wastelanders for its vast size, is in a dire state of disrepair. The city was once a thriving metropolis, but now it is a shadow of its former self. The streets are filled with debris and the buildings are in ruins. The people who remain are struggling to survive in this harsh environment, with deathclaws still present in some dilapidated buildings, not to mention a post-war nuclear detonation in 2162 when the Master was defeated. The NCR clearly did not have the competence or resources to rebuild the city, and it is now up to us to restore it to its former glory. We will need to invest heavily in infrastructure and public services, as well as provide aid to the people who are still living there. It will be a long and difficult process, but we are determined to make Los Angeles a thriving city once again. As it was a world-class city in the pre-war, known worldwide for its entertainment industry and cultural significance, it was the place where the United States exported its culture to the world, some called it Californication."
bib.6.a: "Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather"

bib.7.t: "Miami"
bib.7.d: "The Miami metropolitan area, once a glittering jewel of the American southeast, now sprawls as a vast, battered landscape where the scars of the Great War are etched into every street and shoreline. Before the bombs fell, Miami was a vibrant mosaic of cultures, neighborhoods, and lifestyles: from the pastel art deco facades of South Beach to the bustling markets of Little Havana, the luxury high-rises of Brickell, and the sprawling suburbs stretching west toward the Everglades. The city was a global crossroads, renowned for its nightlife, tourism, and as a gateway to Latin America.\nToday, the region is a patchwork of devastation and resilience. Much of downtown Miami lies in ruins, its iconic skyline fractured by crumbling towers and overgrown with tropical vegetation. The once-busy Port of Miami is choked with rusting ships and debris. The famous beaches, once crowded with sunbathers and tourists, are now littered with driftwood and trash, their sands reclaimed by nature and the encroaching swamps.\nGatorclaws prowl the flooded streets, and the dense mangroves that have overtaken the suburbs hide all manner of post-war horrors. The inland sprawl, once a reflection of Miami`s relentless growth, is now a labyrinth of ruined homes and impassable roads, with the Everglades steadily reclaiming what was once suburbia.\nYet, hope persists. The National Corps for Reconstruction has established a foothold in the city, launching ambitious projects to drain the worst of the swamps, clear debris, and restore basic infrastructure. Efforts are underway to reopen the port and repair the bridges.\nThe challenges are immense, rising waters, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of mutated creatures, but the people of Miami are no strangers to adversity. United by a shared determination to reclaim their home, they are working alongside the NCR to rebuild not just a city, but an entire metropolitan region. In time, Miami may once again become a symbol of hope and renewal, a reflection of the enduring spirit of its people and the promise of a brighter future on the Gold Coast."
bib.7.a: "Miami, baby!"

bib.8.t: "Santa Monica on My Mind"
bib.8.d: "Santa Monica, on the western coast of Los Angeles, was one of pre-war`s Los Angeles most famous locations, known for being a popular resort town and easily recognizable for its iconic pier and ferris wheel, which for some unknown reason are still standing after more than 200 years, even if in a very damaged state. The surviving pier will help immensely in our reconstruction efforts, as it will serve as a reference point in the reconstruction to make the restoration as accurate as possible. The pier will be restored to its former glory, and the surrounding area will be revitalized with new businesses and attractions. The Santa Monica Pier will once again be a symbol of the city, and a reminder of its rich history and culture. We will also work to improve the infrastructure in the area, making it more accessible and attractive to tourists and residents alike, ensuring Santa Monica regains its place as a vibrant community."
bib.8.a: "Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me"

bib.9.t: "Straight Outta Compton"
bib.9.d: "Compton, known in the pre-war as the hub city for its central location in Los Angeles, was once a thriving community. We will take advantage of its central location to coordinate our reconstruction efforts in other areas of Los Angeles, with many workers being housed in Compton. This centralized base will allow us to not only work on Compton, but also downtown LA and Lakewood. \n\nDespite the devastation of the wasteland years, Compton retains a strong sense of identity and resilience among its people. The city`s historic neighborhoods and landmarks, though battered, stand as reminders of its cultural significance. By investing in local infrastructure and supporting community initiatives, we aim to restore Compton as a vibrant center of activity. As we rebuild, Compton will once again become a place where families can thrive, businesses can grow, and the spirit of Los Angeles can shine through."
bib.9.a: "Lets get Compton back on the map"

bib.10.t: "Pink Pony Club"
bib.10.d: "Hollywood stood for many things, fame, glamour, entertainment, but right now it only stands for a bunch of rubble and the surviving sign on top of the mountain. If we are to restore the neighborhoods of Hollywood, much work will need to be done. Some have found pieces of the star walk of fame, and it would be a good idea to restore it with new names to represent our new USA. Apart from that, there is a lot of work to be done in West and North Hollywood, where many of the pre-war film studios were located. West Hollywood, once known for its vibrant nightlife, creative communities, and historic music venues, now lies in ruins. The famous Sunset Strip, once bustling with clubs and theaters, is overgrown and silent. Revitalizing West Hollywood will require rebuilding its iconic venues and supporting the return of artists and performers. By restoring its unique culture and fostering new creative industries, we can ensure West Hollywood once again becomes a beacon of diversity and innovation in the city.\nNorth Hollywood, historically a hub for the entertainment industry, was home to numerous television and film studios, as well as the renowned NoHo Arts District. The area once thrived with theaters, galleries, and a vibrant community of artists and performers. Today, much of North Hollywood is a shadow of its former self, with abandoned sound stages and crumbling art spaces. Rebuilding North Hollywood will mean restoring its creative infrastructure, supporting local artists, and reviving the NoHo Arts District as a center for culture and innovation. By investing in the arts and encouraging new talent, we can help North Hollywood reclaim its legacy as a driving force in the world of entertainment."
bib.10.a: "I'm gonna keep on dancing down in West Hollywood"

bib.11.t: "Summertime In The LBC"
bib.11.d: "Long Beach, once a bustling port city and a hub of maritime trade, is now a shadow of its former self. The city was heavily affected by the Great War, with many of its buildings and infrastructure destroyed. However, the surviving port facilities still hold great potential for revitalization. We will work to restore Long Beach as a major port city, attracting new businesses and investments. The city will also be a key player in our efforts to rebuild the economy of Los Angeles, as it will serve as a major transportation hub for goods and services. We will also work to improve the quality of life for the people of Long Beach, providing them with access to essential services and opportunities for economic growth.Long Beach's iconic shoreline, once filled with sunbathers, surfers, and families, remains one of its greatest assets. The beaches, though scarred by years of neglect, still offer breathtaking views of the Pacific and the promise of recreation and tourism. Restoring the waterfront will be a priority, cleaning up the sand, rebuilding the boardwalks, and reopening the piers will help bring life back to the city. By investing in the beach and its surrounding areas, we can create new opportunities for leisure, tourism, and community gatherings, ensuring Long Beach once again lives up to its name."
bib.11.a: "Long Beach, where the sun shines bright and the waves crash just right"

bib.12.t: "Feel it Still"
bib.12.d: "Orange County might not be part of the Los Angeles county, but it still is part of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, and as such, it is important to restore it to its former glory. Huntington Beach, once known as 'Surf City USA,' still boasts stretches of coastline and battered piers, drawing survivors and wanderers to its shores. Revitalizing the beach and its iconic surf culture will help bring life back to the area. Anaheim, famous for its theme parks and vibrant tourism industry, now stands quiet, but its central location makes it a key hub for trade and rebuilding efforts. Santa Ana, the historic heart of Orange County, retains its civic spirit and diverse communities, and will serve as a center for local governance and cultural revival. Irvine, once a model of planned development and innovation, offers a foundation for new industries and education, with its surviving research centers and university campuses ready to be restored. By focusing on these cities, we can ensure Orange County becomes a beacon of recovery and prosperity in the new world. Even though 200 years have passed, we can still feel the potential of this place."
bib.12.a: "Is it coming back?"

bib.13.t: "I ain't the worst that you've seen"
bib.13.d: "Pasadena, nestled at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, did not escape the devastation of the Great War, its neighborhoods bear the marks of destruction, and many landmarks are damaged or abandoned. However, when compared to the worst hell holes that have emerged across the world, Pasadena is undeniably better off. While cities elsewhere have been reduced to little more than radioactive wastelands or lawless ruins, Pasadena retains a sense of order and continuity. Some of its historic streets and structures, though scarred, remain standing, and the community has managed to preserve a degree of cohesion and resilience that is rare in these times. The city`s surviving institutions, from its old civic buildings to its cultural centers, offer a foundation for recovery that most places can only dream of. Life here is still difficult, and the scars of war are everywhere, but Pasadena`s relative stability and the determination of its people provide hope for a brighter future. With focused effort and investment, Pasadena could become a model for post-war reconstruction, not just for the Los Angeles area, but for the entire wasteland."
bib.13.a: "I am getting tired of the musical references"

bib.14.t: "The City of Angels"
bib.14.d: "Los Angeles has not been this vibrant since the war, while a far cry from its pristine pre-war state, the city is slowly coming back to life. People from around the wasteland are flocking to the city, drawn by its promise of opportunity and the chance to be part of something greater, creating a urbanizing boom. The Santa Monica Pier is once again lit up, with its ferris wheel providing stunning visuals to anyone in the vicinity. Compton, once the hub city, is now a center of coordination for reconstruction, its resilient community leading efforts to restore not just their own neighborhoods but the wider region. \nHollywood`s iconic sign stands watch over a reborn creative district, with new stars joining the walk of fame and the arts returning to the city`s heart. Long Beach`s port bustles with activity, its beaches cleaned and boardwalks rebuilt, making it a gateway for trade and leisure. Pasadena, spared the worst of the devastation, has become a model for post-war recovery, its historic streets and civic spirit inspiring the rest of the city. Orange County`s cities, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, and Irvine are thriving anew, each contributing their unique strengths to the metropolis`s resurgence.\nAbove it all, the Griffith Observatory has been restored, its domes gleaming once more. Angelenos gather there to gaze at the stars, a symbol of hope and the city`s enduring diligence."
bib.14.a: "Los Angeles, the City of Angels, is back in business"

bib.15.t: "The Vastness of Los Angeles"
bib.15.d: "When we started the work on Los Angeles, we knew it would be a monumental task, but we miscalculated the scale of the city. The Los Angeles metropolitan area is extremely vast, the ruins of the city extend for miles and miles, as far as the eye can see. The size of the city is making the reconstruction efforts struggle, and we will need to divert additional resources to it if we want to make any progress."
bib.15.a: "No wonder they call it the Boneyard"

bib.16.t: "Draining the Swamp"
bib.16.d: "The phrase 'drain the swamp' takes on a whole new meaning in the post-war world. The region north of Miami, stretching through Fort Lauderdale and beyond, has become a vast, waterlogged wasteland. Once a vibrant coastal corridor, it is now overrun by thick marshes, stagnant pools, and dense vegetation, providing a perfect breeding ground for gatorclaws and other mutated horrors. The remnants of highways and neighborhoods are barely visible beneath the tangled undergrowth and rising waters. Our National Corps for Reconstruction faces a monumental challenge: to reclaim this land from nature`s relentless advance. Massive drainage projects will be launched, clearing out the worst of the swamps and restoring the natural flow of water. Specialized teams will be deployed to eliminate dangerous wildlife and secure the area for settlers. Infrastructure will be rebuilt from the ground up, with new levees, pumps, and roads designed to withstand the unpredictable climate of the new world. It will be a long and arduous process, but with determination and ingenuity, we will transform this forsaken region into a safe and thriving community once more."
bib.16.a: "Get them out!"

bib.17.t: "North Miami"
bib.17.d: "North Miami, once a thriving mosaic of cultures and communities, now lies at the crossroads of devastation and hope. Before the war, its neighborhoods bustled with life, from the vibrant Haitian and Caribbean enclaves to the bustling markets and family-run businesses that lined its streets. Today, the scars of conflict and neglect are everywhere. Damaged infrastructure, abandoned homes, and contaminated waterways have left the area struggling to survive. The National Corps for Reconstruction will launch a comprehensive initiative to restore the city: hazardous sites will be decontaminated, schools and public spaces rebuilt, and essential services brought back online. Special attention will be given to preserving the unique cultural heritage of the area, supporting local traditions, and fostering community-led recovery efforts. By investing in both physical reconstruction and social revitalization, we aim to transform North Miami into a beacon of resilience and renewal, where its diverse population can once again thrive and shape the future of the region."
bib.17.a: "I hope there are no gatorclaws"

bib.18.t: "South Miami"
bib.18.d: "South Miami, once celebrated for its tree-lined streets, vibrant neighborhoods, and close-knit suburban communities, now finds itself on the edge of total reclamation by the encroaching swamps. The aftermath of the Great War and years of neglect have left much of the area submerged, with overgrown vegetation and stagnant waters replacing parks and homes. Once-bustling shopping centers and schools now stand abandoned, their foundations threatened by rising water and invasive wildlife. Yet, hope remains. Our reconstruction efforts will focus on draining the worst of the swamps, restoring critical infrastructure, and making the area safe for families once more."
bib.18.a: "Its a long road ahead"

bib.19.t: "The Gold Coast"
bib.19.d: "The Gold Coast is finally beginning to reclaim its former splendor. After years of hardship and uncertainty, the region is experiencing a remarkable transformation. The threats that once plagued the area have been driven back, and the relentless advance of the swamps has been halted through determined effort and innovation. New homes rise where ruins once stood, and the streets are once again filled with the sounds of life and laughter. Businesses are reopening, families are returning, and the vibrant cultural tapestry that defined the Gold Coast is being woven anew. The National Corps for Reconstruction, together with the resilient people of Miami, has laid the foundation for a brighter future. As the sun sets over the sparkling coastline, hope shines brighter than ever before. The Gold Coast stands as a monument to the enduring will of its people, a region reborn, ready to thrive and inspire generations to come."
bib.19.a: "Some things are never enough"

bib.20.t: "The Bay Area"
bib.20.d: "The Bay Area, once a shining jewel of the American West Coast, sprawled across the shores of San Francisco Bay, encompassing a diverse tapestry of cities, cultures, and landscapes. At its heart stood San Francisco, famed for its rolling hills, iconic cable cars, and the majestic Golden Gate Bridge stretching across the water, a symbol of resilience and innovation. Before the war, the region was a global center for technology, finance, and culture, with Silicon Valley to the south driving the world's technological revolution, and Oakland, Berkeley, and other cities contributing to a vibrant mosaic of communities.\nNow, the Bay Area lies in a state of ruin and uncertainty. The once-bustling streets of San Francisco are scarred by collapsed buildings and overgrown parks, while the Golden Gate Bridge, battered but still standing, serves as a beacon of hope and a reminder of what was lost. The surrounding cities, Oakland, San Jose, Berkeley, and more, each face their own unique challenges, from shattered infrastructure to displaced populations and lingering radiation in some areas. The bay itself, once teeming with ships and commerce, is now dotted with wrecks and debris, its waters reclaimed by nature and the passage of time.\n\nDespite the devastation, the spirit of the Bay Area endures. With San Francisco`s Chinatown being an example to all of us. Our task is monumental: we must assess the full extent of the damage on the Golden Gate Bridge and get to work on restoring it. While also restoring the surrounding cities and infrastructure."
bib.20.a: "Get to Work"

bib.21.t: "Its hanging by a thread"
bib.21.d: "The Golden Gate Bridge, once a marvel of engineering and a symbol of San Francisco, is in ruins. The bridge has suffered significant damage over the years, with its cables frayed and its towers weakened by the elements and the passage of time. The once vibrant orange color has faded, and the bridge is now a shadow of its former self. A part of the bridge has collapsed, making it impossible to cross and cutting off a vital route for the Bay Area. The remaining structure is unstable and nearing total collapse."
bib.21.a: "We need to act fast"

bib.22.t: "Down in Chinatown"
bib.22.d: "Chinatown stands in an impressive way for a pre-war area, having been maintained by its inhabitants, aided right after the war by the Shi, which possessed great technological prowess. Chinatown will be the central location from where our reconstruction efforts will be dispatched, and with their help and expertise we will be able to restore the Golden Gate Bridge."
bib.22.a: "Their knowledge and expertise will help us greatly"
bib.22.b: "No, its fine, I just didn't think it would be Chinese"

bib.23.t: "In the North of the Bay"
bib.23.d: "Before the Great War, the northern reaches of the Bay Area, including Vallejo, Novato, and Bolinas, were known for their scenic beauty and vibrant waterfronts. The region boasted bustling marinas, lively main streets, and a strong sense of local identity, with residents enjoying access to both the cultural richness of the Bay Area and the tranquility of nearby parks and open spaces.\nIn the aftermath of the war, however, devastation is severe: bridges and roads lie in ruins, neighborhoods are abandoned, and much of the land has been overtaken by wild growth and lingering hazards. Once thriving towns now struggle with isolation and a lack of resources, and the scars of conflict are visible everywhere. The communities that remain face immense challenges, with many institutions lost and only scattered efforts at rebuilding. Restoring the North Bay will require significant investment and determination, as the region must overcome both physical destruction and the loss of its former cohesion. Only through coordinated action can these cities hope to recover and rejoin the wider Bay Area."
bib.23.a: "Get to work!"
bib.23.b: "And blow up Vallejo"

bib.24.t: "The infamous Silicon Valley"
bib.24.d: "Silicon Valley, once the heart of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, is now a shadow of its former self. The region, which was home to some of the world`s most influential tech companies, has been devastated by the Great War and subsequent years of neglect. The remnants of its once-thriving campuses and offices are now overgrown with vegetation and inhabited by mutated creatures. The few survivors who remain in the area struggle to make sense of the ruins, with many of the pre-war technologies still intact but inaccessible due to radiation and other hazards.\nDespite the challenges, there is hope for Silicon Valley. The National Corps for Reconstruction has identified the region as a key area for revitalization, with plans to restore its infrastructure and bring back some of its former glory. The focus will be on creating new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship, while also preserving the unique culture and history of the area. With careful planning and investment, Silicon Valley can once again become a hub of creativity and progress."
bib.24.a: "The platinum chip wont be the last one"

bib.25.t: "The heart of the Bay"
bib.25.d: "San Francisco proper is the heart of the Bay Area, and it is where we will focus our reconstruction efforts. The city has suffered greatly in the years since the Great War, with much of its infrastructure in ruins and many of its buildings destroyed. The National Corps for Reconstruction will work to restore the city to its former glory, with a focus on rebuilding its infrastructure and restoring its cultural heritage. The Golden Gate Bridge will be a key part of this effort, as it is a symbol of the city and a vital transportation link for the region. With careful planning and investment, San Francisco can once again become a thriving metropolis and a beacon of hope for the future."
bib.25.a: "Get to work!"

bib.26.t: "The Eastern Bay"
bib.26.d: "The eastern Bay Area, including cities such as Oakland, Berkeley, and Fremont, has faced significant challenges since the Great War. Once known for its diverse communities and economic activity, the region now deals with damaged infrastructure and abandoned neighborhoods. Efforts are underway to restore essential services, rebuild key areas, and support the local population.

bib.27.t: "The City by the Bay"
bib.27.d: "San Francisco, the City by the Bay, is a place of resilience and renewal. After years of hardship and uncertainty, the city is slowly coming back to life.

The neighborhoods of Chinatown, North Beach, and the Mission District are bustling with activity once more, as people return to their homes and businesses. The Bay Area is once again a hub of creativity and innovation, with new ideas and technologies emerging from its vibrant communities."
bib.27.a: "I Left My Heart in San Francisco"

bib.28.t: "How we got here"
bib.28.d: "200 years after the war, the people living in America have changed significantly, what purists would call 'disgusting mutie deviation' we call it the american melting pot. The american cultural identity has evolved into a even more diverse scene of cultures, traditions, and lifestyles. The influence of various factions, such as the Enclave, the Brotherhood of Steel, and the New California Republic, has also played a role in shaping the new american identity. The fusion of pre-war traditions with post-war realities has created a unique cultural landscape that reflects the resilience and adaptability of the american people."

enc_university.2.t: "University of Nevada, Reno restored!"
enc_university.2.d: "Before the Great War, the University of Nevada, Reno was one of the largest universities in the state of Nevada. Although the university in Las Vegas was still much larger than Reno's, the University of Nevada, Reno had one of the most well-regarded engineering programs in the United States.\n\nNow that we have spent sufficient resources on restoring the buildings tied to engineering and some of the dorms, we have sent some of our engineers to help kickstart the university's faculty."

enc_university.3.d: "The University of Nevada, Las Vegas was the largest and most prominent institution of higher learning within the state of Nevada. Widely known for its College of Hospitality, the university stood as a gateway to education in the hotel and hospitality industry for any interested student. However, decades after the Great War, the university was overrun by raiders and exchanged hands between various raider gangs—first held by the Scorpions, and later falling under the control of the chem-addicted Fiend savages.\n\nNow that the university has been cleared of all its previous inhabitants, the Secretary of Education has handpicked members from the Three Families to help teach within the College of Hospitality with books that were restored from the Pre-War. Additionally, resources have been directed to restore the College of Hospitality, other colleges, and the dormitories."

### Utah 

enc_university.4.t: "University Of Utah, Salt Lake City restored!"
enc_university.4.d: "Once known as one of the top public universities in the western United States, the University of Utah has seen better days. The university was once abandoned and in poor condition until Mormon followers in New Canaan repaired and converted several of its facilities into places of learning and medicine, as they were before the war. Now, we have further restored the university. The University of Utah will once again be a center of research and development, particularly for medical research, in Utah."
enc_university.4.a: "Huh, this was easy!"


enc_university.5.t: "Southern Utah University, Cedar City restored!"
enc_university.5.d: "The White Legs used to call the ruins of Southern Utah University “Ugma-Ooh,” meaning “Shit Basket,” a place where they disposed of various excrements. Some of the people organizing the restoration efforts wondered if they should build a completely new facility in Frisco City, but the head was quoted saying, “What's the fun in that?” After a lengthy process of repairing the university and eliminating the horrible smell, SUU reopened with only minor issues remaining. Now, the university offers fabulous visual and performing arts classes, hopefully encouraging the next generation of actors."

enc_university.6.a: "I hate cannibals.."

enc_university.7.t: "Southern Oregon University, Ashland restored!"
enc_university.7.d: "Arroyo is quite the developed nation, having already mostly restored Southern Oregon University. Although it was not initially intended for education, the facility operated for many years before being closed down due to a radiation leak. It was a hefty price to fix, but one we could afford. After making SOU habitable, we repaired everything that needed it and reopened it to the public. One of the university’s top programs is psychology, which will be useful for the future of this nation as people cope with their past in the harsh wasteland."
enc_university.7.a: "Atleast there isn't any cannibals here.."
